# Data Science & Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of end-to-end data science and machine learning projects, each focused on a different algorithm or technique. Every project includes data preparation, model building, evaluation, and insightful visualizations, with clear documentation throughout.

## Project List

- **01-Linear Regression**: Predicting house prices using the Ames Housing dataset and linear regression.
- **02-Logistic Regression Models**: Classification tasks using logistic regression.
- **03-K-Nearest-Neighbors**: Implementing and analyzing KNN for classification.
- **04-Support-Vector-Machines**: Applying SVMs to various datasets.
- **05-Tree-Based-Methods**: Decision trees, random forests, and boosting methods for classification and regression.
- **06-Naive-Bayes-and-NLP**: Naive Bayes models and natural language processing tasks.
- **07-Kmeans-Clustering**: Unsupervised clustering of country-level data.
- **08-DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering for complex data distributions.
- **09-PCA-Principal-Component-Analysis**: Dimensionality reduction and visualization.
- **10-Linear-Discriminant-Analysis**: Supervised dimensionality reduction and classification.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to a project directory to find its notebook(s), data, and visualizations.
2. Each project contains a README with details on workflow, requirements, and insights.
3. Run the notebooks in Jupyter or your preferred environment.
