# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Project

This project demonstrates the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification tasks. The workflow includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading & EDA**
    - Import and inspect the dataset
    - Visualize feature distributions and relationships
    - Check for missing values and outliers
2. **Data Preprocessing**
    - Handle missing values 
    - Encode categorical variables
    - Feature scaling (important for KNN)
3. **Model Building**
    - Train a KNN classifier
    - Tune hyperparameters (e.g., number of neighbors)
4. **Model Evaluation**
    - Assess performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
    - Visualize confusion matrix and decision boundaries
5. **Interpretation & Visualization**
    - Analyze feature importance (if applicable)
    - Visualize model outputs and decision regions

## Example Visualizations
- Histograms and boxplots of key features
- Correlation heatmaps
- Confusion matrix and ROC curve plots
- Decision boundary visualizations

## Getting Started
- Open `KNN-Project.ipynb` and run the cells in order.
- Plots and figures are saved in the `visualizations/` directory.
- Data is located in the `DATA/` folder.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
